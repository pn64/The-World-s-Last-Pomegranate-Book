[Bakhtiar Ali] Kurdish writer, born in Sulaimaniyah and living in Germany
After writing novels such as:

"Death in the Second Seed" and "Butterfly Sunset" co-wrote the novel "The Last Pomegranate in the World" in 2002.

 

In addition to his works, he has authored several novels and poetry collections. The novel "The Last Pomegranate" of the World "to many

The world's living languages ​​including German, Russian, English, Arabic, Greek, Turkish and more recently Spanish have been translated.

The protagonist of the novel is a man named [Mozafar] Morning, who spent twenty-one years in solitary confinement

Overlooking the wilderness, it is out of the world of human beings, and its days of "life" with only the sand of the desert and the silent [death]

It passes.

 

Twenty-one years later, he is released from prison by his former commander (Jacob Pobar) and in the middle of a prison

Damage is brought.

 

But even this magnificent palace cannot satisfy his thirsty soul for freedom. He escapes from this dummy palace

To search for his only son (his only encouragement of "life") [Serias] in the morning.

The main character of the novel [Mozafar Morning]
 

He started out on the road with his white sisters, Akram the mountaineer, Seyed Jalal

Shams, a glass-hearted man, and finally some other morning, named after his only son,

 

But after these names, there is a third morning [Serias] who does not know which one of them is the real boy.

she is the one . . .
In the following :
 

When [Mozaffar] calls us in the morning on the ship that such a thing or such a character will happen,

It reminds us of Colonel Aurliano Buendia alone against the hundred-year-old novelistic fire squad. . .

 

The narrator of this novel is the main character [Mozaffar Morning]. But the narrative style, like the first-person narrators

That is not familiar to the reader.

 

In this type of narration, though the narrator is a first person, he proceeds the narrative as a knowledgeable narrator, because

Who became aware of everything after twenty-one years of captivity and now embarked on a ship like the captain of this novel,

It tells it in detail to us.

Sometimes a monologue, sometimes a dialogue
And in chapters, they are recorded on tape.

With the exception of the end of the novel and the occasional narrator pulling the reader out of his long flashbacks

It delivers the audience news, the narrative time being "flash back" in the past.

 

Another point is that the ratio between narrative and narrative is balanced and the reader can easily reconstruct the images,

Something that causes the reader to read or slow down in some other novels because of this failure.

 

Confrontations in this novel include: bondage - freedom, "life" - [death], love - no love,

Past - Present and. . . Cited .

 

But the important aspect of this novel is that it is anti-war that is often or indirectly referred to several times during the narrative.

Has been.

 

Here's the beautiful novel:
 

In the midst of wars that have engulfed the people of the Third World and their "life",

What can be as annoying and disgusting as war?

 

The wars mentioned in this novel are often internal and between the religious brothers, and this is a deeper pain.

From the pain that all wars bring. The main character of the novel is [Mozaffar] in the morning after twenty-one years

Captivity kills only his son in his quest. But she's not giving up!

 

From those who heard that there was another morning and went to find him wherever he needed,

But the second [Serias] is also captured, so there is no chance of him meeting his father [Mozaffar] in the morning.

But this time the other [series], about the same age as the other two, enters the "story".

Here's the story:
 

[Mozafar] Third burnt body finds morning in war hospital, unable to speak

And nothing left of his face for identification.

 

But there is no more face and sound that matters to [Mozaffar], for him any kid his age who is displaced by cities and

The mountains have their own morning order, so no matter whether you have anemia or not,

He sends the third infantryman to a hospital in England, and he follows him on a turbulent ship.

It is time for us to take the risky journey with us.

 

What good is it to have writers like this (such as [Bakhtiar Ali] and Khaled Hosseini, etc.) who have a lot of their native Iran too

It is not far from us that they occasionally launch such contemplative novels and, in addition to representing culture and pain, ...

کتاب صوتی آخرین انار دنیا

 خدایا باید به کدام سو بروم؟… این سردرگمی و نابینایی من نشانه ي شلختگی این جهان نیست؟… نشانه ی آن نیست که این جهان هم ظلماتی

 مثل آن بیابان است؟  (ص 164)  كتاب [آخرین انار دنیا ] در نگاه و خوانش اول تصویری است پاره پاره از اشکهای داغ و آه سرد ملتی سرگردان؛ اما…

 در نگاه نخست به این اثر ، در می یابیم که با یک رمان به معنای واقعی رو به رو هستیم .

در طول مسیری ( درونی و بیرونی ) که شخصیت اصلی رمان برای پیدا کردن پسرش طی می کند ، علاوه بر گشوده شدن

رازهایی که بیست و یک سال از حقیقت آنها دور بوده ، «زندگی» نامه ی تک تک شخصیت های دیگر نیز برای خواننده

باز گو می شوند و خواننده گاهی به موازات قصه ی اصلی ، و گاهی در خلال آن ، به ارتباط «زندگی» شخصیت های

دیگر با [مظفر] صبحگاهی و پسرش ( [سریاس] صبحگاهی ) پی می‌برد ، و این خود مشخصه‌ای ممتاز است که

نام رمان ( و نه «داستان» بلند ) را روی این اثر بگذاریم.
